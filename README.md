# Tech Community Singapore - RFCs

This "Request for Comment" repository is for public consultation on issues that affect the Singapore tech community as a whole.

In the spirit of Open Source, we will make the process transparent and open.

Voting however will only be done by community meetup organisers of Singapore-based tech groups (meetup groups and chat groups).
